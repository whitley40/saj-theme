		 <h2>Transport Assessment</h2><p>Planning applications can sometimes be complex and politically sensitive, with transport often considered to be one of the more significant issues in the determination process.</p><p>We prepare statutory documents to accompany planning applications; including Transport Assessments, Transport Statements, Environmental Statements (Transport chapters) and Travel Plans. We use a wide range of transport models, including microsimulation and GIS packages, as well as our expertise to resolve transport issues and provide innovative and cost effective solutions.</p><p>We have a very open minded approach to the projects we undertake, treating every development on its individual merits. As a result of this approach we have delivered a number of innovative solutions that have secured planning consents for sites where previous attempts had been unsuccessful.</p></div>

		<h2>Travel Plan Services</h2><p>We have a team of experts who understand and believe in sustainable transport.</p><p>We have worked with a wide range of clients to develop travel plan strategies which maximise the sustainable transport options for developments. These include developments in a wide range of sectors, including education, residential, industrial, retail, and leisure.</p><p>As well as preparing Travel Plans for planning applications, we also fulfil the role of the Travel Plan Co-ordinator, so we have an appreciation of the travel planning process from concept to delivery. </p><p>We take a very pragmatic view of travel planning and work closely with our clients to ensure that the implications are fully understood, both in terms of the day to day delivery of the travel plans, but also crucially the financial implications. In our experience a well thought through Travel Plan, based on the site specific merits of a given development, can often be an asset in terms of delivering and promoting/marketing a successful development, without the need for unnecessary and costly commitments.</p><p>We practice what we preach. All our staff members use sustainable modes of transport as part of their commuting journeys. We are also an active member of a social enterprise car club, which we use for meetings and site visits.</p></div>
