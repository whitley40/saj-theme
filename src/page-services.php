		 <h2>Development Planning</h2><p>Planning applications can sometimes be complex and political, and transport is often one of the more significant issues in the determination process. </p><p>At S.A.J Transport Consultants, we prepare statutory documents, including Transport Assessments, Transport Statements, Environmental Impact Assessments (Transport), and Travel Plans, to accompany planning applications. We use a wide range of transport models, software and GIS packages as well as our expertise to resolve transport issues and provide innovative and cost effective solutions.</p><p> We have a very open minded approach to the projects we undertake, treating every development on its individual merits and as a result have delivered a number of innovative solutions that have secured planning consents for sites where previous attempts had been unsuccessful.</p></div>

		<h2>Travel Planning Services</h2><p>At S.A.J Transport Consultants, we have a team of experts who understand and believe in sustainable modes of transport.</p><p>We have worked with a wide range of clients to develop travel plan strategies which maximise the sustainable transport options for their developments. These include education, residential, industrial, energy, retail, and leisure developments.</p><p> While we prepare Travel Plans for applications, we also fulfil the role of Travel Plan Co-ordinators. We therefore understand the long term consequence which the Travel Plan initiatives may have during and after the completion of a development. We are keen to make sure that a Travel Plan is tailored to suit the merits of the development in order to avoid unnecessary commitments.</p><p> We practice what we preach. All our staff members use sustainable modes of transport as part of their commuting journeys. We are also an active member of a social enterprise car club, which we use for our meetings and site visits.</p></div>
